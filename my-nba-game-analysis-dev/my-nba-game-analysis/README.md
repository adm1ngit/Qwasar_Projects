## Task
What is the problem? And where is the challenge?
The problem is to process the given array of play-by-play moves of an NBA game and create a summary of the game in the form of a dictionary containing statistics for each player on both teams. The challenge lies in extracting the relevant information from the given format of the play-by-play moves and calculating the required statistics for each player.

## Description
